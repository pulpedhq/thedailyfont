<p id="about">
	
	My name is Matt Harrison, I live in Manchester, England and I'm an Architecture graduate with a passion for the web and design. I'm also a coding geek too. I love to code in PHP, CSS and HTML. Typography has been a long passion of mine and I love to scour the web for examples of good practice in type. I'm by no means an expert on the subject of typography but I created this site to share my journey of learning about good type and how to craft it. It's likely that I will make mistakes along the way or post things that aren't totally right. Please feel free to contribute by commenting or emailing me at <a href="mailto:matt@thedailytype.co.uk">matt@thedailytype.co.uk</a>. If you spot any glaring errors I shall correct them straight away.<br /><br />
	
I built this site using the PHP framework Codeigniter, check it out here <a href="http://www.codeigniter.com">www.codeigniter.com</a>
